#  PKU-Baichuan-MLSystemLab 
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Peking University ML System Lab - Baichuan Inc. Joint Laboratory.

We are dedicated to advancing research in Data-Centric Machine Learning (DCML), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Machine Learning Systems (ML Systems). 

Our goal is to develop effective and efficient data preparation systems and algorithms that support and enhance the performance of machine learning models.
